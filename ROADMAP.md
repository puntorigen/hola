## Project's ROADMAP

### Version 0.0.1:
- [x] Ability to automatically seach LinkedIn profiles and invite them
- [x] Ability to automatically send customized template based chat messages only to those who haven't receive it
- [ ] Ability to keep a trace of actions within an internal JSON db. 

### Future ideas and wishes:
- Add 'create_profile' commmand to create a search profile within the DB
- Make a local web server page GUI for using the tool (and edit visually the templates)
